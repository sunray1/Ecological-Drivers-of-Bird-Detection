## Overview
This project examines how ecological conditions influence human detection of birds. Using NEON bird surveys paired with standardized, colocated environmental data, we model detection probability as a function of site-level and survey-level ecological covariates and compare these models to baseline occupancy models without ecological predictors.

## Data
- NEON terrestrial bird point-count surveys  
- Colocated ecological data (e.g., vegetation structure, biomass, hydrology, microclimate)  

## Methods
- Fit species-specific occupancy models for all birds  
- Baseline models without ecological detection covariates  
- Covariate models with detection as a function of individual site- or survey-level ecological variables  
- Compare models using Δ log-likelihood, slope estimates, and 95% confidence intervals  

## Synthesis
Across species, we summarize how each ecological covariate affects detection by evaluating consistency in effect size, direction, and model improvement. This allows identification of ecological conditions that generally increase or decrease human detectability of birds.
